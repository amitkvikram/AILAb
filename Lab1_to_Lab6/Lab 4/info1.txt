Brief Description:
    We have a two dimensional n*n matrix representing current state of board.
    Empty block is initially in the position (row: n, column: n). Whenever 
    agent takes an action, function takeAction is called which subsequently 
    calls updateState function of environment. updateState function first checks
    if action is valid or invalid, if action is valid it  swaps values of
    empty block(n*n) with block it's going to replace and then update current 
    position of empty block.
    Invalid Action: An action is invalid if after performing action block goes
    out of the board.
