Brief Description:
    We have a two dimensional n*n matrix representing current state of board.
    Agent is initially at starting position. Whenever agent takes an action,
    function takeAction is called which subsequently calls updateState function
    of environment. updateState function first checks if action is valid or invalid,
    if action is valid agent moves to new block accroding to the action taken.
    Invalid Action: An action is invalid if after performing action block goes
    out of the board or New block is blocked.
